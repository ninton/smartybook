In \"func\" mode, it will look for a function named after each element (xmltag_ELEMENT for start tags and xmltag_ELEMENT_ for end tags), and in \"event\" mode it uses a set of generic callbacks.\n\nSince version 1.2.0 there's a new XML_Parser_Simple class that makes parsing of most XML documents easier, by automatically providing a stack for the elements.\nFurthermore its now possible to split the parser from the handler object, so you do not have to extend XML_Parser anymore in order to parse a document with it."

In most cases it does exactly what you expect it to do.\nTry reading a RSS file with XML_Unserializer and you have the whole RSS file in a structured array or even a collection of objects, similar to XML_RSS.\n\nSince version 0.8.0 the package is able to treat XML documents similar to the simplexml extension of PHP 5."
